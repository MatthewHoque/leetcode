Initial approach just looking at the question I started thinking dynamic programming.

making an example on excel that looks like:
a	b	a	c	d	e	f	g	h	c
									
									
a	b	c	c	d	e	f	g	h	c

just to visually think it through
A little further thinking based on only needing the LENGTH on no repeats made me think perhaps a sort of set or hashmap feature would solve this more simplistically.



After 2 submissions I found an error with my approach in handling 1 character strings and a more complicated problem that stems from me oversimplifying my solution


I can either
keep track of how long the string was prior(1)
truncate the string(2)

(1) would need to have some sort of tracking on indices
(2) would need to truncate from the repeating to the left O(n) added

After fixing this error we run into another one with "abba"
