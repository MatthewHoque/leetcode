# Initial Thoughts

Honestly right off the bat this seems like a VERY straightforward question, almost feels like it should be an easy, which makes me then think that it might be harder than usual if I can't see any complications yet AHH!

So first thought is an O(n) solution where I just go and subtract each element from its previous and have a counter running...

Assuming the subsequence definition from what I can tell is CONTINUOUS arithmetic differences, otherwise we can just throw a hashmap at it
