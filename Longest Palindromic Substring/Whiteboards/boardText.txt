First initial reaction is that this is definitely dynamic programming or if I'm wrong perhaps there is a recursive solution but even just thinking that "outloud" makes it sound like its not a recursive thing, I am 90% sure it is a recursive solution.

After looking further into it thinking about potential solutions by looking at an excel setup i amde (Sheet1) I realize that this was the setup for longest common subsequence. 

I will have to approach this problem by looking at my notes (see solution jpeg the top "BONO" example)

After looking at my notes I can't particuarly figure out the algorithm

I have actually done this leetcode before and have the solution python file in my backups of my class, it was an extra credit assignment. It seems I have forgotten mostly everything regarding this problem. I will be looking at my notes.
I ended up caving in and looking at online resources because of my notes being an output of the NUMBER of the longest palimdrone. 

I've encountered 3 approaches that I will take a look at and compare their runtime and different properties


Solution 1:

Solution 2:
https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-substring/solution/ (first solution)
 decided to switch solution 2 as it was more relevant than the prior selection
 This being the best solution I will be giving it more thought, I'll try and see if i can find the leetcode problem for longest commmon substring

Solution 3:
